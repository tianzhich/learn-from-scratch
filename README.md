# learn-from-scratch

## What?

*Learn from scratch* means [reinventing some wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel) or rebuilding some minimal functions using pure javascript or css. For example, a scrollToTop, lazy load and pullToRefresh, etc. I want to implement them without the help from some libraries or frameworks.

## Why?

This is useful for leaning exercise. From the [StackExchange](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/29524):

> Reinventing the wheel is **good** when you want to understand and learn something complex, rolling your own makes sense.

So I will make my own wheels in this repository, from scratch.
